# USEMARCON GUI
USEMARCON GUI is a simple user interface for USEMARCON. It allows browsing of records (original and converted alongside) and editing of USEMARCON rules.  
  
USEMARCON GUI is also suitable for standalone browsing of MARC files. Features include:  
- "Syntax" highlighting for easy readability  
- A simple search capability  
- Exporting of selected records in different formats  
- Printing of records  
  
There is no documentation for USEMARCON GUI, but it is hopefully quite straightforward to use. To start with a conversion, only the four fields on the top of the window need to be filled. Input File is the file of records to be converted. USEMARCON Conversion is the ini file of the conversion package to be used. USEMARCON Program is the location of the actual USEMARCON program (download from the link above). Output File is the destination for converted records. Note that USEMARCON will overwrite any existing output file without warning.  
  
USEMARCON GUI is developed with [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/).  The program can be built on at least Windows, Linux and macOS. On Linux it may be necessary to have at least one printer (e.g. cups-pdf) installed to avoid trouble.
